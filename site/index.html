    	<p>"Very good, Bella. Now this is what you have to do. I want you to go to your mother's
house. Next to the phone there will be a number. Call it, and I'll tell you where to go from

with some way out of this nightmare. There was no escape, no reprieve. I could see only
one possible end looming darkly in my future. The only question was how many other
people would be hurt before I reached it.</p>
